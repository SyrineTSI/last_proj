## Model Details
Model Name: Decision Tree Classifier
Model Type: Supervised Learning
Implementation: Python scikit-learn library
Version: 1.0

## Intended Use
This model is intended to predict the income level (<=50K or >50K) based 
on census data attributes. It can be used to classify individuals into 
two income categories.

## Training Data
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Census Income Data
Description: The training data consists of census data attributes such as age, 
education level, marital status, occupation, race, sex, native country, etc.
Size: 32,561 instances
Preprocessing: Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding. 

## Evaluation Data
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Census Income Data
Description: The evaluation data is a subset of the census data not used 
during training, with the same attributes and format as the training data.

## Metrics
Precision: 0.75
Recall: 0.80
F1 Score: 0.77

## Ethical Considerations
Fairness: The model was evaluated for fairness across different demographic 
groups based on race and sex. No significant bias was detected in this evaluation.
Privacy: Steps were taken to ensure that personally identifiable information 
(PII) in the dataset was handled according to legal and ethical guidelines.

## Caveats and Recommendations
Caveats: The model performance may vary with changes in demographic distribution 
or societal trends. It is recommended to monitor the model's performance 
periodically and retrain if necessary.
Recommendations: Use caution when interpreting predictions for individual cases, 
and consider additional domain knowledge and context in decision making processes.
